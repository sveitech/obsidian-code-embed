# Code Embed

Embed an external codefile as a code-block. The codefiles can be outside
of the Obsidian vault.

## Basic Example

Create a code-block with the tag `codefile` and a single line which is a
path to the file to be loaded:

    ```codefile
    path/relative/to/vault/main.cpp
    ```  
	  
	or   
	  	
    ```codefile  
    path/on/your/disk/main.cpp  
    ```	  
	

In Reading view, the file will be loaded from disk and rendered as a
code-block.

## Syntax Highlighting

Auto with file extension...
